# Discord Music Bot

A music-playing bot for Discord that can join voice channels, play songs from YouTube, and manage a queue of tracks. This bot allows users to play, skip, pause, resume, and stop music, along with managing the song queue directly from Discord commands.

## Features

- **Join Voice Channel**: The bot can join your voice channel.
- **Play Songs**: Play songs from YouTube by searching for song names.
- **Queue Management**: Add songs to a queue, skip songs, and view the queue.
- **Pause/Resume Music**: Pause the current song and resume it later.
- **Stop Music**: Stop the music and disconnect the bot from the voice channel.
- **Reconnection Logic**: Handles reconnection automatically if the bot disconnects from the voice channel.

## Requirements

Before running the bot, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Dependencies

You can install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Where the `requirements.txt` file should contain the following:

```txt
discord.py==2.4.0
yt-dlp==2024.11.18
python-dotenv==1.0.1
```

1. **discord.py**: The library used for interacting with the Discord API.
2. **yt-dlp**: A fork of youtube-dl used to download and extract audio from YouTube videos.
3. **python-dotenv**: Used to manage environment variables (for securely storing the Discord bot token).

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shirozy/Discord-Music-Bot/
cd discord-music-bot
```

### 2. Create a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file to store your Discord bot token securely. You can copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, open the `.env` file and paste your **Discord Bot Token** in place of `TOKEN_HERE`:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
```

### 3. Running the Bot

Once youâ€™ve set up the `.env` file and installed dependencies, you can run the bot with:

```bash
python bot.py
```

When the bot starts, it will log into Discord and sync the slash commands (`/commands`) with your server.

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot fails to connect to a voice channel**: Ensure the bot has the correct permissions in your Discord server, including the `Connect` and `Speak` permissions for voice channels.
- **Bot is not playing music**: Ensure you have a valid internet connection and that `yt-dlp` is working correctly by checking for errors in the console logs.
- **No response from the bot**: Make sure the bot is online and that the token in `.env` is correctly set.
